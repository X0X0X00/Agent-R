I do not seem to have access to the plastic fork directly, as it hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the available objects in the workshop. Since my task involves checking the plastic fork's conductivity, I need to find a way to either locate the plastic fork or check if there might be an assumption that it could be in my current environment. 

As the environment does not contain the plastic fork, I will proceed to investigate the door to the hallway in case the fork is beyond it.

Since I can't find the thermometer or the unknown substance B in the hallway, I will look for the door to the living room, as it may lead to the place where I can find what I need.
