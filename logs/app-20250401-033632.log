In the outside area, I have spotted a baby beaver, a crocodile egg, and a baby mouse. To find the animal with the longest lifespan, I need to analyze which of these has the longest expected lifespan. Among the options, adult crocodiles are known to have long lifespans. However, the crocodile is still in egg form, so I need to focus on the adult species or the beaver. 

I should look more closely at the baby beaver since beavers can live up to about 10-15 years in the wild, while crocodiles in general may live longer, but I need to verify whether the egg will develop into something that will also have a long lifespan.

In the outside location, there are several animals: a baby beaver, a baby mouse, and a crocodile egg. I need to focus on the animal with the longest lifespan among these. Generally, crocodiles have the longest lifespans among these animals, especially when they are adults. However, since I only see a crocodile egg, I can't determine the age of the crocodile. I should focus on confirming the lifespan of the existing animals or consider the crocodile once it hatches.

In the outside location, I see several animals: a baby beaver, a crocodile egg, and a baby mouse. To find the animal with the longest lifespan, I should focus on these animals. Among them, the crocodile has one of the longest lifespans, even if I only see its egg; it can live for many decades after hatching. However, baby beavers and baby mice generally do not live as long as crocodiles. I should focus on the crocodile egg, as it represents an animal known for a long lifespan.

I see several animals here: a baby beaver, a crocodile egg, and a baby mouse. To find the animal with the longest lifespan, I need to focus on the adult versions or the potential of these creatures reaching adulthood. Crocodiles, for example, can live many decades, while beavers can live around 10-12 years. However, baby animals do not yet represent their potential lifespan. I should focus more on the crocodile egg, as it could indicate a long-lived crocodile.

In the living room, I can see the two boxes: a purple box and a yellow box. Both are empty. However, I still haven't found the thermometer needed to measure the temperature of unknown substance B. I should look further in the living room, possibly under or around the furniture to locate the thermometer.

Action:
look at the couch and the chair to check for the thermometer.

In the living room, I see two empty boxes (a purple box and a yellow box) as well as a chair and a couch with a pillow. However, there is still no sign of the thermometer. I need to clarify my surroundings further to locate the thermometer before I can proceed with measuring the temperature of unknown substance B.

Action:
look around again
