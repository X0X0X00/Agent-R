The outside location is now accessible. As I step outside, I can see various animals around, including a tortoise, a whale, and a parrot. 

Thought:
Among these animals, I need to identify which one has the longest lifespan. Tortoises are known for their longevity, with some species living over 100 years, while certain whales can live for over 200 years. Parrots generally have a shorter lifespan compared to these two. I will look closely at the tortoise and the whale to confirm their lifespans.

Action:
look at the tortoise and the whale.
