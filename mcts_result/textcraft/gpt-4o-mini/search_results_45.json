Crafting commands are of the format \"craft [target object] using [input ingredients]\".\nEvery round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the state and instruction. You can \"get\" an object (ingredients) from the inventory or the environment, look-up the game inventory by \"inventory\", or \"craft\" (target) using any of the crafting commands. You can use ONLY these crafting commands provided, do not use your own crafting commands. However, if the crafting command uses a generic ingredient like \"planks\", you can use special types of the same ingredient e.g. \"dark oak planks\" in the command instead.\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought:\n ... \n\nAction:\n ...
